== Introduction

This project is a multiplayer Pictionary game where players can draw and guess words in real-time. One player draws a randomly assigned word while others try to guess it. The entire project, including this README, was created with Sourcegraph Cody (Claude 3.7 Sonnet extended thinking).

== Overview

The Pictionary game is built as a client-server application using the following technologies:

* ASP.NET Core for the server
* SignalR for real-time communication
* WPF for the client user interface
* .NET 8.0 framework

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with three main projects:

* `Pictionary.Client`: WPF client application for player interaction
* `Pictionary.Server`: ASP.NET Core server handling game logic and coordination
* `Pictionary.Shared`: Common models and constants shared between client and server

== How It Works

=== Game Flow

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
skinparam StateBackgroundColor LightBlue
skinparam StateBorderColor Blue

[*] --> WaitingForPlayers : Game starts

state WaitingForPlayers {
  [*] --> CheckingPlayers
  CheckingPlayers --> [*] : 2+ players joined
  CheckingPlayers --> CheckingPlayers : < 2 players
}

WaitingForPlayers --> Countdown : 2+ players connected
Countdown --> Playing : After 5 seconds
Playing --> RoundEnd : Word guessed correctly
RoundEnd --> Countdown : After 3 seconds

Playing : Word assigned to drawer
Playing : Other players make guesses
Playing : Points awarded for correct guesses

state "<<choiceState>> PlayerCountCheck" as PlayerCountCheck
RoundEnd --> PlayerCountCheck
PlayerCountCheck --> Countdown : 2+ players remain
PlayerCountCheck --> WaitingForPlayers : < 2 players

=== Components

==== Client (WPF Application)

The client application provides a graphical interface where users can:

* Connect to the game server with a chosen username
* Draw on a canvas when selected as the drawer
* Submit guesses when not drawing
* See the current game status and player list

==== Server (ASP.NET Core)

The server manages the game state and coordinates between players:

* Handles player connections and disconnections
* Manages game state transitions
* Broadcasts drawing updates to all players except the drawer
* Validates word guesses
* Assigns words to the drawer
* Keeps track of scores

==== Shared Models

Common models used by both client and server:

* `Player`: Represents a player with connection ID, name, score, and status
* `GameState`: Contains the current state of the game
* `DrawingUpdate`: Represents a drawing action to be transmitted
* `Constants`: Shared constants like hub URL

== Technical Implementation

=== Real-Time Communication

The game uses SignalR for real-time bidirectional communication:

* The server exposes a SignalR hub (`PictionaryHub`)
* Clients connect to this hub to send and receive messages
* The server broadcasts drawing updates in real-time
* Game state changes are pushed to all connected clients

=== Game State Management

The `GameService` on the server manages the game state and logic:

* Player tracking and management
* Word selection and assignment
* Game state transitions (waiting, countdown, playing, round end)
* Score calculation

=== Drawing Implementation

The drawing functionality uses WPF's Canvas element:

* Mouse events (down, move, up) are captured to draw lines
* Drawing coordinates are transmitted through SignalR
* Non-drawing players receive these coordinates and render the same lines
* Clear canvas functionality is synchronized across all clients

== How to Run

=== Prerequisites

* .NET 8.0 SDK
* Visual Studio 2022 or similar IDE with .NET support

=== Running the Server

1. Navigate to the Pictionary.Server directory
2. Run the server using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dotnet run
----

The server will start on http://localhost:5088.

=== Running the Client

1. Navigate to the Pictionary.Client directory
2. Run the client using:

[source,bash]
----
dotnet run
----

3. Multiple clients can be started to play the game

== Game Rules

1. A minimum of 2 players is required to start the game
2. Once enough players join, a 5-second countdown begins
3. One player is randomly selected as the drawer and receives a word to draw
4. Other players try to guess the word based on the drawing
5. The first player to guess correctly earns 10 points, and the drawer earns 5 points
6. After a correct guess, a new round begins after 3 seconds
7. If the drawer disconnects, a new round starts with a new drawer

== Code Structure

=== Client

* `MainWindow.xaml/cs`: Main UI and client-side game logic
* `App.xaml/cs`: Application entry point

=== Server

* `Program.cs`: Server configuration and startup
* `PictionaryHub.cs`: SignalR hub for real-time communication
* `GameService.cs`: Game logic and state management

=== Shared

* Models for data transfer between client and server
* Constants shared across projects
